Installation:
-------------
Depending upon your WordPress upload and post size limits, the plugin file size might be too large to install the plugin via
WordPress upload routine. In those cases, you either need to increase the upload and post size limits, or upload the plugin
via FTP directly to your server and then activate it in WordPress. Consult the manual for more information.


Update:
-------
To update an existing installation of the plugin, simply upload the extracted plugin folder "ts-visual-composer-extend" to your
WordPress "plugins" folder (.../wp-content/plugins) and replace the existing folder with the same name and all files inside of
that folder with the new version.
